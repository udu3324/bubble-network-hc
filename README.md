# bubble network

A website that visualizes who you are connected to in slack.

## how it works

Oauth access gives slack endpoints to reveal what **public** channels you are in. It can then be scanned with the most recent 1000 messages. From there, it checks if the message is a thread and if you are the author or have replied in it.

**How is this a Good Metric**    

It's not. Well, its close enough. Slack does offer scopes to reveal dmed users, group conversations, or private channels, but the bot itself has to be invited to them to see it. I do not know a workaround to this unless if everyone is willing to invite the bot to every channel or it gets admin workspace access.

## database 

I use supabase but any could work. Two tables are needed to store data, one for slack profile data and another for network data.

**cache table**
```sql
create table public.cache (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
  slack_id text null,
  username text null,
  profile_picture text null,
  modified_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
  constraint cache_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint cache_slack_id_key unique (slack_id)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;
```

**network table**
```sql
create table public.network (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
  modified_at timestamp with time zone null,
  slack_id text null,
  id_list text[] null,
  id_list_special text[] null,
  constraint network_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint network_slack_id_key unique (slack_id)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;
```

## development

To setup a dev enviornment, make sure you have nodejs installed with npm. Clone it into your favorite IDE and run the commands below!

```
npm install

npm run dev
```

Slack OAuth **DOES NOT WORK** in the dev enviornment as the callback points back to the real domain. I think there's a way to fix this but im too lazy. As a workaround, you can oauth from production and export your localstorage variables and reimport into localhost.
